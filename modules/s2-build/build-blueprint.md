# Build

There is no contract stage — read the spec directly, and let every piece trace back to a line in it.

## Steps

Launch 3 subagents, in order. Each has one responsibility and tags its trace line `S2.DECOMPOSER` / `S2.INITIALIZER` / `S2.CODER` (trace rule).

**Before the first subagent runs, do the [build-start sweep](#checkpoints)** — fold any pending spec annotations into the spec first, so decomposition reads the annotated spec.

1. **Decompose the spec into a build list.**
   Read the spec's Task decomposition. Write one feature per task into `app/feature-list.json`:

   ```text
   name · what goes in · what comes out · how you know it's done · status = todo
   ```

   Translate only — never invent a feature the spec didn't ask for.
   Done when: every spec task is one row in `feature-list.json`.

2. **Initialize the shared foundation, once.**
   Read the spec's Tech stack, Inputs & interfaces, and screens; write them into `app/app-spec.json` — the config every feature shares (one database, one auth path, one design system). Honor the **credential checkpoint** (below). *Why: pinning this once stops the build reinventing auth five different ways.*
   Done when: `app-spec.json` holds the shared config and every required credential is present.

3. **Write the code, feature by feature.** For each feature in the list:
   1. Check the **comment checkpoint** (below) against `app/comments.json`.
   2. Write the code. Draw any screen with the `frontend-design` skill from the spec's "What good looks like."
   3. Append one RATIONALE line to the trace (trace rule).
   4. Set the feature's status to `done` and make one git commit.

   Done when: every feature is `done`, committed, and traced.

## Checkpoints

**Build-start sweep** (before the first subagent reads the spec): process every `status:"new"` entry in `app/comments.json` **first**, so decomposition runs on the annotated spec, not the stale one. Spec-targeted comments (`target:"artifact:spec.html"`) are folded into the spec before anything is decomposed — this is what "the build folds your notes in before it starts" means mechanically. Run the comment checkpoint below on this pass, then continue to decomposition.

**Credential checkpoint** (initialize step):
- HALT IF a needed key or credential is missing — ask the user to put it in `.env`. Never ask for the value in chat, and never write a credential value into any file except `.env`. Never start the build half-wired.

**Comment checkpoint** (build-start sweep + the coding step, before each feature): read `app/comments.json` for new comments — a comment is a change request, not a debug item. An entry may carry a `quote` — the exact spec text the user selected; use it to locate the edit. A `quote` with empty-ish `text` means "this passage needs attention" — interpret it against the spec. Route each:

| Comment touches | Action |
|---|---|
| an unbuilt feature | update its `feature-list.json` row first |
| the spec's intent | edit the spec and re-decompose that task |
| an already-built feature | hold it for eval/debug |

Mark the comment `picked-up` and log why in the trace.

**One-way doors** (doors rule, [`../shared-rules.md`](../shared-rules.md)): most changes are reversible — roll back and redo, no harm. Three are not, and need a written reason in the trace *first*:
- inventing a feature with no spec task
- using a tech-stack choice not in `app-spec.json`
- marking a feature done with no trace line

## Hand-off

Hand the running app + `feature-list.json` (what got built) + the trace (why) to **Eval**, which checks the output against the spec's checks.
